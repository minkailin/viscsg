\section{Two-dimensional disks with beta cooling}\label{result_2d}
We begin in the 2D limit with beta cooling  to make connection 
with previous studies. The disk
material assumed to be confined to the midplane so $\delta v_z=0$. 
We make the replacements 
$\rho \to \Sigma$ and $P\to\Pi$, the vertically-integrated
pressure, and set $\Gamma=1$ without loss of generality. 
%The perturbations $\delta\Sigma$, 
%$\delta\Pi$, $\delta v_x$ and $\delta v_y$ have no vertical
%dependence and $\delta v_z=0$. 
The gravitational potential perturbation remains 3D and its midplane
value is given by    
\begin{align}
  \delta \Phi(z=0) = -\frac{2 \pi G}{|k|}\delta\Sigma
\end{align}
\citep{shu70}.
 
We obtain from the linearized equations 
an algebraic dispersion relation $s = s(k)$. It is simplest
to write this  
in terms of the dimensionless growth rate $S = s/\Omega$ and
wavenumber $K=kH = k c_{s0}/\Omega$ as
\begin{align}\label{thindisk}
  f(S,K)\equiv AD - BC = 0,   
\end{align}
where the functions $A,B,C,D$ are given in Appendix \ref{2ddisp}. 

\subsection{Inviscid limit}\label{2d_inviscid}
Here we neglect viscosity by setting 
$\alpha = \alpha_b = 0$. This implies an external,
time-independent heat source must be invoked to balance the imposed
cooling rate in equilibrium ($\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{ext}\neq 0$). Alternatively, we are assuming 
viscosity is only important for setting up thermal equilibrium, and
can be neglected for the pertubations. This is useful as the resulting
instabilties are only due to self-gravity.  In any case, we are
considering the \emph{sole} effect of cooling on stability. 

Eq. \ref{thindisk} simplifies to  
\begin{align}\label{inviscid}
%  &\beta S^3 + S^2 - \beta \left\{ \frac{2|K|}{\qtwo} - \left[2(2-q) +
%    \gamma K^2\right]\right\}S \notag\\ &- \left[\frac{2|K|}{\qtwo} - 2(2-q)\right]
%  = 0. 
  S^2 = \frac{2|K|}{Q} - 2(2-q) - \left(\frac{\theta + \beta \gamma
    S}{1+\beta S}\right)K^2, 
\end{align}
similar to the classic Lin-Shu dispersion relation. The first term on
the right-hand-side represents destabilization by self-gravity; 
the second and third terms represent stabilization by rotation and
pressure, respectively. The imposed cooling term only affects the
pressure response. 

Eq. \ref{inviscid} is a cubic equation in $S$. Applying the
Routh-Hurwitz criterion, we find that stability is ensured if 
\begin{align}
  \gamma > \theta \quad \text{and} \quad 
  Q > \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\theta(2-q)}} 
\end{align}
are both satisfied. Thus, the question of stability does not depend on
the cooling rate $\beta$. The system becomes more unstable with
decreasing $\theta$.   

Consider the most unstable wavenumber $|K_*|$ at which $\p S/\p |K| =
0$ and $S = 
S_*$. By differentiating Eq. \ref{inviscid}, we obtain 
\begin{align}\label{kstar}
%  |K_*| = \frac{1}{\gamma \qtwo} \left(1 + \frac{1}{\beta S_*}\right). 
  |K_*| = \frac{1+\beta S_*}{Q\left(\theta + \gamma \beta S_*\right)}
\end{align}
Inserting this into Eq. \ref{inviscid}, we find the maximum growth
rate satisfies
\begin{align}\label{inviscid_max}
%  S_*^3 + \left[2(2-q)  - \frac{1}{\gamma \qtwo^2}\right]S_* - \frac{1}{\gamma
%    \qtwo^2 \beta} = 0.
  S_*^2 = \frac{1+\beta S_*}{Q^2\left(\theta + \beta\gamma S_*\right)}
  - 2(2-q).
\end{align}
General solutions to this cubic for $S_*$ are unwieldy, but simple
results may be obtained in special cases, discussed next. 
%We plot examples of the maximimum growth rate as a function of cooling
%times in Fig. \ref{2d_inviscid}. General expressions for the solution
%of Eq. \ref{inviscid_max} are unwieldy, but simple results may 
%be obtained for special cases, as discussed below.

%    the value of $Q$ such that the disk is marginally stable in the

\subsubsection{$\theta = 0$ and $Q=Q_\mathrm{crit}$}  
Beta cooling with $\theta=0$ is typically employed in numerical
simulations of self-gravitating disks \citep{gammie01}. There, 
a steady state corresponds to the imposed cooling entirely balanced by heat generated through 
gravito-turbulence. In the present framework, this gravito-turbulence
is assumed to provide a constant 
background heating ($\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{ext}$) and does
not enter the linearized equations. Cooling, however, is still imposed in the perturbed state. 
From the discussion above, this system is unconditionally unstable for
finite $Q$. The most unstable wavelength decreases with decreasing
$\beta$. The $\beta\to0$ limit corresponds to a pressureless disk.  

% it is always
%possible to find a sufficiently small scale such that pressure effects
%are   

Specifically, let us consider a disk with 
\begin{align}\label{qcrit_def}
  \qtwo = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\gamma(2-q)}}\equiv Q_{\mathrm{crit}},
\end{align} 
so that it is marginally stable in the absence of cooling.  
How does introducing finite cooling destabilize the system? 
Inserting Eq. \ref{qcrit_def} into Eq. \ref{inviscid_max} and setting
$\theta=0$, we find 
%In this case the coefficient of 
%$S_*$ in Eq. \ref{inviscid_max} vanish, so that  
\begin{align}\label{sstar}
  S_*^3 = \left(\frac{1}{\gamma Q_\mathrm{crit}^2 \beta}\right). 
\end{align}
The maximum growth rate, $S_*\propto \beta^{-1/3}$, smoothly
increases with decreasing $\beta$. Instability does not require the
cooling time to be below some 
critical value. 

Nevertheless, we can define a characteristic cooling
time $\beta_*$ as that which removes pressure support against
self-gravity over the only natural lengthscale in the problem, $H$. We
thus set $|K_*|=1$ and find, for the Keplerian disk, 

\begin{align}\label{betastar}
  \beta_* = \frac{1}{\left(\sqrt{\gamma} - 1\right)^{3/2}}. 
\end{align}
%Table \ref{bstar_compare} compares Eq. \ref{betastar} to 
%previously reported values of $\beta_c$ 
%for which fragmentation
%occurs.
It is interesting to note that this $\beta_*$ is similar to previously reported 
values of the cooling times, $\beta_c$, below which fragmentation
occurs on a dynamical timescale. We compare these in Table
\ref{bstar_compare}, showing rough agreement. 

%{\bf brief physical interpretation. gravito-turbulent heating is a
%  constant background heating - it does not affect perturbations about
%  the turbulent state.  
%  imposed beta cooling works on all
%  scales. but `gravito-turbulence' only makes sense on scales larger
%  than averaging procedure (probably about $H$). }
%{\bf wild guess: fragmentation had high resolution because internal
%  structure of forming-clumps become resolved. internal turbulence
%  helps collapse.

\subsubsection{Passive disk with $\theta = 1$}
Beta cooling with $\theta=1$ corresponds to 
`thermal-relaxation' in a strictly inviscid disk: the temperature is restored to its initial
value over the cooling time \citep{lin15,mohandas15}. In this case 
$\beta\to 0$ corresponds to an isothermal disk and $\beta
\to \infty$ corresponds to an adiabatic disk. (These two limits are
equivalent for $\gamma=1$.) The most unstable wavenumber and growth
rates vary weakly with $\beta$.   

%nothing interesting here 

%\subsubsection{Expected maximum stress}
%{\bf for notes only} 
%A reasonable assumption is that in the non-linear regime 
%there is an associated turbulent viscosity that may be estimated  
%as $\nu \sim l^2s$, where the lengthscale $l\sim 1/k$; which
%translates to $\alpha\sim S/K^2$.  
%
%Using Eq. \ref{pressureless}, we find that 
%\begin{align}\label{max_alpha}
%  \mathrm{max}\left(\frac{S}{K^2}\right) = \frac{3^{3/2}}{2^{7/2}\left(2-q\right)^{3/2}Q^2}
%\end{align}
%in the limit $\beta\to 0$. This maximum is occurs at wavenumber $|K| =
%4Q(2-q)/3$, which is $O(1)$ for typical disk parameters we consider. 
%Eq. \ref{max_alpha} indicates that $\alpha\propto Q^{-2}$, as
%suggested by \cite{lin87}. Note that although
%$\mathrm{max}(S)\to\infty$ as $\beta\to0$ (Eq. \ref{sstar}), 
%the associated stress is bound because the
%most unstable modes occur at the smallest scales. In fact, for
%$Q=Q_\mathrm{crit}$, we find $s(K_*)/K_*^2 \propto \beta $ as
%$\beta\to 0$, so transport by the most unstable mode is expected to be
%unimportant.

%  \caption{A measure of the
%    associated stress that can be expected in the non-linear
%    regime. The horizontal dotted lines
%    correspond to Eq. \ref{max_alpha}.}
%\end{figure}

\subsection{Viscous disk}\label{2dvisc}
We now consider a viscous disk with 
$\mu=-1,\,\lambda=0$ as discussed in \S\ref{visc_model}. We first
check in Appendix \ref{gammie_check} that our dispersion relation
reduces to that of \cite{gammie96} in the appropriate limit (namely
$\beta\to\infty$).  

To see the effect of cooling, we simplify the dispersion relation,
Eq. \ref{thindisk}, by assuming $|\beta S|\ll 1$. Then  
for $|K| \to 0$ we find
\begin{align}\label{gammie_smallk}
%  S \sim \frac{\alpha |K|^3}{(2-q)Q},%derived assuming |beta*S|<<1 
%  S \sim \frac{\alpha K^2\left[2|K|Q^{-1} - \gamma K^2 + 2\alpha q
%    (2-q)(\gamma-1)K^2\right]}{2(2-q)+\gamma K^2 - 2|K|Q^{-1}} %derived
                                %assuming |\beta S|>>1
  S\simeq \frac{\alpha K^2}{2(2-q)}\left(\frac{2|K|}{Q} - \theta
  K^2\right), 
\end{align}
which coincides with \citeauthor{gammie96}'s Eq. 18 for vanishing
wavenumber. For $|K|\to\infty$ we find
\begin{align}\label{gammie_bigk}
  %  S \sim \frac{2}{Q|K|}\left(\frac{4}{3}\alpha + \gamma\beta\right)^{-1}.
  S \simeq\left(\frac{2}{Q|K|} - \theta\right)\left(\frac{4}{3}\alpha + 
  \alpha_b + \gamma\beta\right)^{-1}.
\end{align}



For $\theta\ll1$ a rough measure of the maximum growth rate can be obtained by
equating Eq. \ref{gammie_smallk} and \ref{gammie_bigk}\footnote{If
  $\theta$ is not small and/or $Q$  is large then one may just use Eq. \ref{gammie_smallk}
  to maximize $S$ over $K$, see the $\theta=0.3,\beta=100$ curve in the bottom
  panel of Fig. \ref{gammie_rate_plot}}.  
This exercise yields 
\begin{align}\label{gammie_maxrate_simple}
  %S_* \simeq
  %\frac{1}{Q}\left(\frac{\alpha}{2-q}\right)^{1/4}\left(\frac{6}{4\alpha
%+ 3\gamma\beta}\right)^{3/4}. 
  S_*\simeq \frac{
    6^{3/4}\left[\alpha\left(4\alpha +
      3\alpha_b + 3\gamma\beta\right)\right]^{1/4} - 3\theta
    Q(2-q)^{1/4}}{Q\left(4\alpha + 3\alpha_b +
    3\gamma\beta\right)(2-q)^{1/4}}. 
\end{align} 
%gravito-viscous instability 

As a numerical example, we consider a model with $\alpha_b=0$ and
$\alpha=\alpha(\beta)$ given by thermal equilibrium,
Eq. \ref{alpha_beta_relation}. Furthermore, we set
\begin{align}
  Q = \frac{Q_\mathrm{crit}}{\sqrt{\alpha}},\label{Qalpha}
\end{align}
to mimic a basic state maintained by gravito-turbulence where one can 
expect the dimensionless stress $\alpha \sim Q^{-2}$ \citep{lin87}.  

Fig. \ref{gammie_rate_plot} show growth rates as a function of the
wavenumber $k$ obtained from the dispersion relation
Eq. \ref{thindisk}. The limiting behavior for small/large $K$ are
well-captured by Eq. \ref{gammie_smallk} and
\ref{gammie_bigk}. Comparing the two panels shows that increasing the
irradiation level ($\theta$) surpress  
small-scale perturbations.

    Eq. \ref{gammie_smallk} and \ref{gammie_bigk}. Top: without

    \label{gammie_rate_plot}}
\end{figure}

Fig. \ref{gammie_maxrate_plot} show the maximum growth rate as a
function of the cooling time $\beta$ for the case $\theta=0$. 
%We set $\alpha_b=\theta=0$ and 
%consider three cases (top to bottom panels): 
%\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
%  \item $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $Q$ are independent; \label{casea}
%  \item $\alpha=\alpha(\beta)$ from thermal equlibrium
%    (Eq. \ref{alpha_beta_relation}) and $Q$ specified separately; \label{caseb}
%  \item $\alpha(\beta)$ from Eq. \ref{alpha_beta_relation} and
%    assuming $Q = Q_\mathrm{crit}/\sqrt{\alpha}$. This mimics a
%    basic state maintained by 
%    gravito-turbulence where the viscosity coefficient $\alpha \sim
%    Q^{-2}$ \citep{lin87}.
%    \label{gvisc}
%\end{enumerate} 
There is good agreement between numerical results and
Eq. \ref{gammie_maxrate_simple} for $\beta \gtrsim 1$. The assumption
of $|\beta S|\ll 1$ is not well satisfied at smaller $\beta$ which
explains the mismatch there. 

Eq. \ref{gammie_maxrate_simple} gives the limiting behavior (for
negligible $\theta$) as 
\begin{align*}
  S_*\propto \begin{cases}
    \frac{\alpha^{1/4}}{Q\beta^{3/4}} \propto \beta^{-3/2} &  \beta
    \gg \alpha, \\
    \frac{1}{Q\sqrt{\alpha}}  \propto \mathrm{const.} & \beta \ll \alpha,
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}
where the second proportionality applies Eq. \ref{alpha_beta_relation}
and \ref{Qalpha}. The disk is formally unstable for all $\beta$, but
the growth timescales are long ($>10$ orbits) for $\beta \gtrsim
20$. This region is marked by the vertical dashed-dotted lines in
Fig. \ref{gammie_maxrate_plot}.  


As $\beta\to 0$ the required viscous heating to set up an equilibrium
state diverges ($\alpha\to\infty$). 
In the present model the increased
viscous damping, which is stabilizing, is balanced by the decreasing
(and hence destablizing) $Q$ required to achieve large $\alpha$
(Eq. \ref{Qalpha}). 

Physically, however, we expect $\alpha < 1$. In fact, numerical
simulations of self-gravitating disks show there is a maximum $\alpha$
($\sim 0.06$) that can be sustained before fragmentation
\citep{rice11}. We can interpret this result in our linear framework.
%We can use our case (\ref{gvisc}) to interpret this
Suppose it is possible to balance rapid cooling ($\beta\lesssim1$) 
by generating a large gravito-turbulent heating rate
($\alpha\gtrsim 1$) through a small $Q$. Fig. \ref{gammie_maxrate_plot} 
shows that such a system is dynamically unstable with 
growth rate $s = O(\Omega)$.  Thus we do not expect rapidly-cooled,
self-gravitating steady disks to exist for extended periods of
time. This is consistent with previous numerical simulations performed
by \cite{lodato05}.   

%Case (\ref{gvisc}) is consistent with
