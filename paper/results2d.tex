\section{Two-dimensional disks with beta cooling}\label{result_2d}
We begin in the 2D limit with standard beta cooling  to facilitate comparison 
with previous studies. The disk
material is assumed to be confined to the mid-plane, and $\delta v_z=0$. 
We make the replacement  
$\rho \to \Sigma$, re-interpret $P$ as the vertically-integrated
pressure, and set $\Gamma=1$. % without loss of generality. 
%big gamma only controls vertical structure
%can absorb big gamma into def of cs
The gravitational potential perturbation remains 3D and its mid-plane
value is given by    
\begin{align}
  \delta \Phi(z=0) = -\frac{2 \pi G}{|k|}\delta\Sigma
\end{align}
\citep{shu70}.
 
The linearized equations yield an algebraic dispersion relation $s =
s(k)$. We write this  
in terms of the dimensionless growth rate $S = s/\Omega$ and
wavenumber $K=kH = k c_{s0}/\Omega$ as
\begin{align}\label{thindisk}
  f(S,K)\equiv AD - BC = 0,   
\end{align}
where the functions $A,B,C,D$ are given in Appendix \ref{2ddisp}. % Note
% that these functions, as given, do not assume any $\alpha$-$\beta$
% relation.
We use this generalized dispersion relation  to investigate GI driven 
by cooling in \S\ref{2d_inviscid}; and GI driven by viscosity 
in \S\ref{2dvisc}. 




\subsection{Inviscid limit}\label{2d_inviscid}
We first simplify the problem by setting $\alpha = \alpha_b = 0$. This
eliminates viscous heating and forces in the linearized problem, 
allowing us to quantify the \emph{sole} effect of cooling on the 
perturbations. %KMK
We emphasize that destabilization is independent of the effect of decreasing temperature on the instantaneous
value of the classic-$Q$. A time-independent heat source should be
invoked to balance the imposed cooling to allow an equilibrium to be
defined ($\mathcal{H}_\mathrm{ext}\neq 0$). For example, we could assume
that the viscosity only provides a background heating and does not
play an active role in the perturbed state. 

 %may or may not be true in a real
                                %disk because we are using viscosity
                                %as proxy for turbulence
                                %maybe turb heating actually behaves
                                %like background heat source only 
	%KMK interesting points. discuss later?

Eq. \ref{thindisk} becomes 
\begin{align}\label{inviscid}
%  &\beta S^3 + S^2 - \beta \left\{ \frac{2|K|}{\qtwo} - \left[2(2-q) +
%    \gamma K^2\right]\right\}S \notag\\ &- \left[\frac{2|K|}{\qtwo} - 2(2-q)\right]
%  = 0. 
  S^2 = \frac{2|K|}{Q} - 2(2-q) - \left(\frac{\theta + \beta \gamma
    S}{1+\beta S}\right)K^2, 
\end{align}
similar to the classic dispersion relation
(Eq. \ref{classic_dr}), which may be obtained by taking the limit
$|\beta S|\to\infty$. %then setting gamma=1. other params fixed
                      %(finite theta)
The first term on the right-hand-side represents destabilization by self-gravity; 
the second and third terms represent stabilization by rotation and
pressure, respectively. The imposed cooling/irradiation only affects the
pressure response. %KMK no...? {\bf do we need to explain the terms again?}

Eq. \ref{inviscid} is a cubic equation in $S$. The 
Routh-Hurwitz criteria imply that stability is ensured if 
\begin{align}\label{stable_condition}
  \gamma > \theta \quad \text{and} \quad 
  Q > \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\theta(2-q)}} 
\end{align}
are both satisfied. 
%gamma/theta condition is related to some kind of thermal instability
%oscilitory convection?? 
%second condition concerning Q is associated with self-g 
A third criterion, $2(2-q)\gamma Q^2>1$, is formally required, but this
is implied by Eq. \ref{stable_condition}. 
Notice these conditions do not actually depend on the cooling time. 
At fixed $Q$, the second stability condition eventually fails for
decreasing $\theta$, i.e. if perturbations are allowed
to cool to sufficiently low temperatures.  

%{\bf KMK maybe more words here about apparent trend of $Q \rightarrow \inf$ for small $\theta$
%even forward ref. lengthscales below?}

If only real growth rates are considered, then violating the second
condition in Eq. \ref{stable_condition} alone is sufficient for instability. 
%from property of cubic crossing the real axis 
In that case the wavenumbers satisfying
\begin{align}
  \theta K^2 - \frac{2}{Q}|K| + 2(2-q) < 0 
\end{align}
are unstable. The range of unstable wavenumbers
increases with decreasing irradiation $\theta$. For $\theta\ll 1$ this range is 
$(2-q)Q\lesssim|K|\lesssim2/\theta Q$. Without irradiation there is no
upper limit to unstable wavenumbers, which could have implications for
numerical simulations probing large wavenumbers and small scales 
at high resolution (see \S\ref{prev_works}). 

Consider the most unstable wavenumber $|K_*|$ at which $\p S/\p|K| =
0$ and $S = S_*$. By differentiating Eq. \ref{inviscid}, we obtain 
\begin{align}\label{kstar}
%  |K_*| = \frac{1}{\gamma \qtwo} \left(1 + \frac{1}{\beta S_*}\right). 
  |K_*| = \frac{1+\beta S_*}{Q\left(\theta + \gamma \beta S_*\right)}
\end{align}
%Eq. \ref{kstar} describes how the most unstable  mode is affected by
%cooling ($\beta$) and external heating ($\theta$). 
Inserting this into Eq. \ref{inviscid}, we find the maximum growth
rate satisfies
\begin{align}\label{inviscid_max}
%  S_*^3 + \left[2(2-q)  - \frac{1}{\gamma \qtwo^2}\right]S_* - \frac{1}{\gamma
%    \qtwo^2 \beta} = 0.
  S_*^2 = \frac{1+\beta S_*}{Q^2\left(\theta + \beta\gamma S_*\right)}
  - 2(2-q).
\end{align}
Eq. \ref{kstar}---\ref{inviscid_max} imply $\p_\beta|K_*|,\,\p_\beta
S_*<0 $ for $\gamma>\theta$. Then as cooling becomes more rapid, the maximum 
growth rate increases, and the most unstable wavelength decreases. 
%show dK*/dbeta < 0 
%by diff K* wrt beta and diff S* wrt beta from the equations
%and elim dS*/d beta 
For $|S_*|\ll1$, Eq. \ref{inviscid_max} gives the simple solution 
\begin{align}
  \beta S_*\simeq \frac{1-2(2-q)Q^2\theta}{2(2-q)Q^2\gamma-1}.  
\end{align} 
%Assuming the denominator is positive definite (see below for the case
%when it vanishes),  
Thus $S_*\to0$ as $\beta\to\infty$, but growth rates are never zero
for any finite $\beta$. That is, the disk can be formally unstable for
arbitrarily long cooling times.     
 
Fig. \ref{invisc_theta} shows growth rates in a $Q=1.7$ disk  
as a function of the cooling time $\beta$ for two irradiation levels
$\theta=0.1,\,0.33$. The vertical lines mark characteristic cooling
times beyond which the growth timescale is long compared to the
dynamical time. Increasing irradiation stabilizes the
disk, and faster cooling is required to achieve the same growth 
rate as in a disk with weaker irradiation.

    lines mark the cooling times beyond which 
    growth rates are longer than 10 orbits. 
    \label{invisc_theta}}
\end{figure}



Next, we consider the two limiting cases: $\theta=0$, so perturbations are
cooled towards zero temperature \citep[typically employed in
numerical simulations, e.g.][]{gammie01}; and $\theta=1$, where the
equilibrium disk temperature equals the irradiation temperature.  






\subsubsection{$\theta = 0$}\label{theta0}
For $\beta$-cooling with $\theta=0$, the disk is unconditionally
unstable for finite $Q$, although instability occurs on smaller scales
as $Q$ increases.  The $\beta\to0$ limit corresponds to a 
pressureless disk (not merely isothermal).   

%for definiteness 
Let us consider a disk with 
\begin{align}\label{qcrit_def}
  \qtwo = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\gamma(2-q)}}\equiv Q_{\mathrm{crit}},
\end{align} 
%{\bf KMK $\gamma = \theta$ from eq. 47? I'm missing something}
which is the condition for marginal stability in an adiabatic disk. 
How does finite cooling destabilize the disk?  
Inserting Eq. \ref{qcrit_def} into Eq. \ref{inviscid_max} with 
$\theta=0$, we find 
\begin{align}\label{sstar}
  S_*^3 = \frac{1}{\gamma Q_\mathrm{crit}^2 \beta}. 
\end{align}
The maximum growth rate, $S_*\propto \beta^{-1/3}$, smoothly
increases with decreasing $\beta$. 
%Instability formally occurs for
%arbitrarily long but finite cooling times. 
%Instability does not require the
%cooling time to be below some critical value. 

We can define a characteristic cooling
time $\beta_*$ as that which removes pressure support against
self-gravity over the natural lengthscale in the problem, the
scale-height $H$. We thus set $|K_*|=1$ and find, for the Keplerian
disk,  

\begin{align}\label{betastar}
  \beta_* = \frac{1}{\left(\sqrt{\gamma} - 1\right)^{3/2}}. 
\end{align}
This equation gives remarkably similar values 
of the cooling times below which 
numerical simulations show dynamical disk fragmentation 
\citep{gammie01,rice05,rice11}. These simulations employ the same beta  
cooling prescription with $\theta=0$, and determine the fragmentation
boundary, $\beta_c$, as a function of the adiabatic index $\gamma$.  
Table \ref{bstar_compare} shows rough agreement between $\beta_*$ and 
$\beta_c$.

\subsubsection{$\theta = 1$}\label{theta1}
Standard beta cooling with $\theta=1$ corresponds to 
`thermal relaxation': the temperature is restored to its initial
value over the cooling time \citep{lin15,mohandas15}. In this case no
additional heat source need be invoked to define an inviscid steady state. From
Eq. \ref{stable_condition}, the instability condition is $Q<1$. %no
                                %beta dependence
This is the same as the classic Toomre condition for an isothermal
disk (which may be obtained from Eq. \ref{inviscid}  by taking
$|\beta S|\to 0$). In this respect, a 
fully irradiated disk, in which the equilibrium temperature is set
externally, behaves isothermally regardless of the cooling time. 


%The most unstable wavenumber and growth
%rates vary weakly with $\beta$.  
% {\bf KMK: summarize boring result? not sure 
%what this simplifies to in comparison to other limits?}.

%nothing interesting here 



%\subsubsection{Expected maximum stress}
%{\bf for notes only} 
%A reasonable assumption is that in the non-linear regime 
%there is an associated turbulent viscosity that may be estimated  
%as $\nu \sim l^2s$, where the lengthscale $l\sim 1/k$; which
%translates to $\alpha\sim S/K^2$.  
%
%Using Eq. \ref{pressureless}, we find that 
%\begin{align}\label{max_alpha}
%  \mathrm{max}\left(\frac{S}{K^2}\right) = \frac{3^{3/2}}{2^{7/2}\left(2-q\right)^{3/2}Q^2}
%\end{align}
%in the limit $\beta\to 0$. This maximum is occurs at wavenumber $|K| =
%4Q(2-q)/3$, which is $O(1)$ for typical disk parameters we consider. 
%Eq. \ref{max_alpha} indicates that $\alpha\propto Q^{-2}$, as
%suggested by \cite{lin87}. Note that although
%$\mathrm{max}(S)\to\infty$ as $\beta\to0$ (Eq. \ref{sstar}), 
%the associated stress is bound because the
%most unstable modes occur at the smallest scales. In fact, for
%$Q=Q_\mathrm{crit}$, we find $s(K_*)/K_*^2 \propto \beta $ as
%$\beta\to 0$, so transport by the most unstable mode is expected to be
%unimportant.

%  \caption{A measure of the
%    associated stress that can be expected in the non-linear
%    regime. The horizontal dotted lines
%    correspond to Eq. \ref{max_alpha}.}
%\end{figure}


\subsection{Viscous disk}\label{2dvisc}
We now consider a viscous disk with parameters $\mu=-1,\,\lambda=0$ in our
adopted viscosity law, Eq. \ref{visc_law}. In the 2D case this implies
$\nu\Sigma$ is constant.   
%\S\ref{visc_model}. 
We check in Appendix \ref{gammie_check} that our dispersion relation
reduces to previous results for viscous GI in the isothermal limit (by
taking $|\beta S|\to~\infty$ and $\gamma=1$).   

It is useful to consider several limiting cases.
To see the effect of cooling and irradiation, we simplify the
dispersion relation, Eq. \ref{thindisk}, by assuming $|\beta S|\ll
1$. Then for $|K| \to 0$ we find
\begin{align}\label{gammie_smallk}
%  S \sim \frac{\alpha |K|^3}{(2-q)Q},%derived assuming |beta*S|<<1 
%  S \sim \frac{\alpha K^2\left[2|K|Q^{-1} - \gamma K^2 + 2\alpha q
%    (2-q)(\gamma-1)K^2\right]}{2(2-q)+\gamma K^2 - 2|K|Q^{-1}} %derived
                                %assuming |\beta S|>>1
  S\simeq \frac{\alpha K^2}{2(2-q)}\left(\frac{2|K|}{Q} - \theta
  K^2\right), 
\end{align}
which coincides with \citeauthor{gammie96}'s Eq. 18 for vanishing
wavenumber. For $|K|\to\infty$ we find
\begin{align}\label{gammie_bigk}
  %  S \sim \frac{2}{Q|K|}\left(\frac{4}{3}\alpha + \gamma\beta\right)^{-1}.
  S \simeq\left(\frac{2}{Q|K|} - \theta\right)\left(\frac{4}{3}\alpha + 
  \alpha_b + \gamma\beta\right)^{-1}.
\end{align}

For $\theta\ll1$ a rough measure of the maximum growth rate can be obtained by
equating Eq. \ref{gammie_smallk} and \ref{gammie_bigk}\footnote{If
  $\theta$ is not small and/or $Q$  is large then one may just use Eq. \ref{gammie_smallk}
  to maximize $S$ over $K$, see the $\theta=0.3,\beta=100$ curve in the bottom
  panel of Fig. \ref{gammie_rate_plot}}.  
This exercise yields 
\begin{align}\label{gammie_maxrate_simple}
  %S_* \simeq
  %\frac{1}{Q}\left(\frac{\alpha}{2-q}\right)^{1/4}\left(\frac{6}{4\alpha
%+ 3\gamma\beta}\right)^{3/4}. 
  S_*\simeq \frac{
    6^{3/4}\left[\alpha\left(4\alpha +
      3\alpha_b + 3\gamma\beta\right)\right]^{1/4} - 3\theta
    Q(2-q)^{1/4}}{Q\left(4\alpha + 3\alpha_b +
    3\gamma\beta\right)(2-q)^{1/4}}. 
\end{align} 
%gravito-viscous instability 


%KMK moved fig ref. 
To compute growth rates numerically, 
we consider a model with $\gamma=1.4$, $\alpha_b=0$ and 
$\alpha=\alpha(\beta)$ given by thermal equilibrium
(Eq. \ref{alpha_beta_relation}). Furthermore, we relate   
\begin{align}
  Q = \frac{Q_\mathrm{crit}}{\sqrt{\alpha}},\label{Qalpha}
\end{align}
%with $Q_\mathrm{crit}$ given by 
to mimic a basic state maintained by gravito-turbulence where one
might expect the dimensionless stress $\alpha \sim Q^{-2}$
\citep{lin87}.

Fig. \ref{gammie_rate_plot} shows growth rates as a function of the
wavenumber obtained from the dispersion relation

well-captured by Eqs. \ref{gammie_smallk} and
\ref{gammie_bigk}. Comparing the two panels 
%of Fig. \ref{gammie_rate_plot} 
shows that increasing the
irradiation level ($\theta$) suppresses small-scale
perturbations. %(This also occurs in the inviscid case.)

%The case $\beta=100$ is shown for completeness but is not physically
%consistent with gravito-turbulence, as the assumed $Q(\alpha)$
%relation (Eq. \ref{Qalpha}) imply $Q\gg 1$, whereas $Q$ of order unity
%is expected for a gravito-turbulent background. Nevertheless, it
%illustrates that viscous GI is qualitatively different to classic
%GI. Here, instability can occur for high $Q$.

Fig. \ref{gammie_maxrate_plot} shows the maximum
growth rate (top panel) and the corresponding wavenumber (bottom
panel) as a function of the cooling time $\beta$ for $\theta=0$.  
There is good agreement between numerical growth rates and
Eq. \ref{gammie_maxrate_simple} for $\beta \gtrsim 1$. 
%The assumption
%of $|\beta S|\ll 1$ is not well satisfied at smaller $\beta$ which
%explains the mismatch there. 
Eq. \ref{gammie_maxrate_simple} gives the
limiting behavior for this case as

  S_*\propto \begin{cases}
%    \frac{\alpha^{1/4}}{Q\beta^{3/4}} \propto \beta^{-3/2} 
    \alpha^{1/4}\beta^{-3/4}Q^{-1}\propto \beta^{-3/2}

  \end{cases}
\end{align}
%{\bf KMK physically what is the limit $\beta \ll \alpha$?}
where we have applied Eq. \ref{alpha_beta_relation}
and \ref{Qalpha}. %The second limit corresponds to a hypothetical
%situation where rapid cooling is balanced by large viscous heating
%(we discuss why this). 
The disk is unstable for all $\beta$, but
growth timescales are long ($>10$ orbits) for $\beta \gtrsim
20$. %increase beta -> drop alpha -> increase Q. latter two expected
     %to stablize
This region is marked by the vertical dashed-dotted line in
Fig. \ref{gammie_maxrate_plot}. The optimum wavenumber decreases with
the cooling time for $\beta\lesssim O(1)$ because larger scales are 
more resistant to the associated increase in viscous damping. This is
evident from the dispersion relation in the large wavenumber limit,
Eq. \ref{gammie_bigk}, showing increasing viscosity weakens
small-scale modes. 
%{\bf KMK this is
%confusing b/c viscosity is in general acting on larger scales than pressure. al%so damping -> dissipation or 
%angular momentum transport?}


%{\bf maybe move following to discussion}
Numerical simulations of gravito-turbulent disks show there is a
maximum $\alpha$ ($\sim 0.06$) that can be sustained before
fragmentation \citep{rice05}. We can interpret this result in our
linear framework. 
Suppose it is possible to balance rapid cooling ($\beta\lesssim1$) 
by generating a large gravito-turbulent heating rate
($\alpha\gtrsim 1$) through a small $Q$ (second case in
Eq. \ref{high_visc}). Fig. \ref{gammie_maxrate_plot}  
shows that such a disk would be dynamically unstable with 
growth rate $s = O(\Omega)$. This is due to the direct effect of viscous 
stress promoting instability, rather than cooling. Thus, we do not expect rapidly-cooled, 
and hence highly turbulent, self-gravitating disks to persist beyond
dynamical timescales.
%KMK
We might interpret fragmentation as the response to the instability of the
highly viscous state. This is consistent with previous numerical
simulations performed by \cite{lodato05}.
