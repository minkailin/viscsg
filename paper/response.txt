1) The results in this paper are based on local, axisymmetric, linear
study. It should be clearly stated in the Abstract. 

We now state in the abstract that the analysis is axisymmetric and
done in the shearing box approximation. Since the models are
vertically-global, we do not use `local' here to avoid confusion. 

***********************************************************************************
2) In section 1.2., in a turbulent system with strong 3D shocks and energy
deposition at different disk height, is the local viscous dissipation still valid? 

This may depend on the origin of turbulence. In the case of
interest here --- gravito-turbulence --- global 3D numerical simulations show
that a local, viscous description is valid for low-mass, thin disks
(Lodato \& Rice, 2004). Shi \& Chiang (2014) have also
confirmed the alpha-beta relation, which reflects local viscous
dissipation, holds in their local 3D simulations with
vertically-extended domains. 

These are stated in Section 1.3, where we specifically discuss
gravito-turbulence. 

***********************************************************************************
3) Clarification of the small \gamma (e.g. in equation (11) and big \Gamma
(e.g., in equation (24)) might be needed. Even for the small \gamma,
there is a difference between 2D adiabatic index and 3D adiabatic
index.  

After Eq. 11 we state that \gamma is the adiabatic index as that appears 
in the ideal gas law for both 2D or 3D disk models. 

After Eq. 23 we state that \Gamma is the polytropic index that
controls the disk vertical structure. It is not relevant to the 2D
problem since in that case \Gamma can be absorbed into the defintion
of the soundspeed.  

***********************************************************************************
4) In equation (23), is the equilibrium T_{eq} a function of z or just the
midplane value? Later on, when big \Gamma is set to unity, it seems to be a
constant over z. This also leads to the next question, what is the physical
justification of using \Gamma=1 in this study for both 2D and 3D cases?


We clarify these issues in Section 2.2.1. 

After Eq. 25, we make it explicit that the equilibrium temperature
field T_{eq} is generally a function of z. However, in numerical
calculations we consider vertically isothermal disks with
\Gamma=1. This is the case for protoplantary disks at large radii
where heating is dominated by irradiation, leading to a vertically
isothermal disk.  

As state above, \Gamma is only relevant to the 3D problem. 

***********************************************************************************
5) In section 4.1, the first paragraph is puzzling. How could the 'viscosity', a proxy
of the turbulence, do not play an active role in the perturbed state,
especially the turbulence might be driven by gravity itself? 

The perturbations that the reviewer refers to are
the flucuations, with respect to a strictly laminar state, associated
with maintaining gravito-turbulence. In the present
problem, however, we are interested in perturbations away from this 
quasi-steady, gravito-turbulent state. We thus regard the
gravito-turbulent state as an equilibrium state to which we (further)
perturb. We clarify this in the new sub-section 1.4. in the
introduction. 

The gravito-turbulent viscous heating balances the imposed cooling so
that a quasi-steady state may be defined (our basic state) and
perturbed. However, it is not clear what is the role of this
gravito-turbulent viscosity on the perturbations away from such a
basic  state. In the simplest case discussed in Section 4.1, we assume
it has no effect.  

This is in fact what is done implicitly in the literature when
discussing fragmentation or clump formation in cooling, 
self-gravitating disk simulations. There, the effect of the ambient
gravito-turbulent viscosity on the forming-clump is neglected, as 
one usually only compares adiabatic heating and the imposed cooling.  
This comparison is encapsulated in the dispersion Eq. 46 (which also
includes rotation). 

**********************************************************************************
6) Near the end of section 4.1.1, Rice+(2005,2011) are three-dimensional
simulations not 2D as discussed in this section.


At the end of Section 4.1.1. we highlight that the Rice et al (2005)
simulations are global 3D disks. The Rice et al (2011) simulations are
local 2D. 

**********************************************************************************
7) Is relation (58) with a fixed Q_{crit} usually used for time evolving,
out-of-equilibrium systems? Is this consistent with the local analysis which 
has fixed equilibrium state? 


Eq. 58 applies to the equilibrium disk. In the problem formulation
(e.g. Appendix  A), Q and alpha are assumed to be independent
parameters that define the basic state. In reality, 
however, depending on the physical nature of the basic state Q and
alpha may be related. For example, if the viscous stress is associated
with gravito-turbulence then Q and alpha may be inversely related. So
large values of Q should have small levels of associated stress. 
We adopt the simple functional form of Eq. 58, following Lin \&
Pringle 1987, in order to make analytic progress (Eq. 59). 

More complicated functional forms of Q(alpha) are used in the
literature (Rafikov 2015) but this should yield similar results as
long as stresses increase with self-gravity. Indeed we do this in
Section 6 where Q and alpha are worked out for a physical disk model
based on the 1D accretion disk equations.   

**********************************************************************************

8) Near the end of section 4.2, the Authors discuss the fragmentation as a
result of growth rate s=O(\Omega) due to strong viscous stress. But is a
strong growth rate found in Fig 3 equivalent to fragmentation in the turbulent
disk? 

As stated in Section 7.3, our linear approach cannot model
fragmentation directly. However, the high growth 
rates found in some cases (e.g. in Fig. 3) implies that the assumed 
quasi-steady, gravito-turbulent basic state cannot be 
sustained. We speculate disk fragmentation 
reflects this, since previous numerical simulations show
that gravito-turbulence or fragmentation are the only outcomes of
cooling, self-gravitating disks. 

We now state this assumption in the new sub-section 1.4, before
carrying out the analyses. 

***********************************************************************************
9) How does the vertical velocity \delta v_z obtained in section 5.2 compare
with recent 3D local simulations by Shi & Chiang (2014)? 

This comparison cannot be made because Shi \& Chiang (2014)
investigate the properties of the quasi-steady, gravito-turbulent
state, which has an associated \delta v_z. However, our framework regards the
gravito-turbulent as a basic state in vertical 
hydrostatic equilibrium (Section 2.2). That is, vertical and radial
velocities are neglected compared to Keplerian rotation in our basic 
state. 

************************************************************************************
10) In Figure 9, is there any reason to label the line of t_c\Omega=4 instead
of t_c\Omega=3?

The vertical line marks the region beyond which the alpha>0.1.
For the 3D, non-irradiated case in Fig. 9, beyond this
radius the cooling time drops below 4/Omega. For the 2D, irradiated
case with Mdot=1d-6 in Fig. 8, this radius corresponds to a cooling
time of < 3/Omega.

This is now stated in the captions of Fig. 8 and 9. 

************************************************************************************

11) In section 7.1 when discussing the recent issue of numerical convergence,
the Authors attribute the issue to resolution. However, Paardekooper, Baruteau, 
& Meru (2011) and Rice, Forgan & Armitage (2012) argued the convergence problem 
is caused by either initial conditions or the cooling algorithm using SPH. 
Please comment on these aspects in the paper.

We highlight the results from these papers in Section 7.1 in order to
give a more complete picture of the convergence issue at present, but
refrain from over-interpreting these simulations with our simple
model. 

The issue with initial conditions, as raised by Paardekooper et al
(2011) applies to global simulations where internal edges may appear,
which is where fragmentation occurs. Our local models cannot
accommodate such global effects. 

Rice et al (2012) show that the standard SPH cooling algorithm may contribute
to non-convergence because of the mismatch in scale in the cooling and
the SPH smoothing length, although the precise mechanism to
non-convergence is not clear.  However, grid-based simulations also display
non-convergence, with the most recent example being Baehr \& Klahr
(2015). Thus the way in which cooling is implemented may not be
entirely explain non-convergence.

Based on our analysis (the dispersion relation Eq. 1), we point out
that non-convergence observed in simulations with beta cooling
and no floor temperature may be related to the fact that sufficiently 
small-scales are always unstable, and these become accessible with
increasing resolution.
