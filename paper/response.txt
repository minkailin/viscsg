1) The results in this paper are based on local, axisymmetric, linear
study. It should be clearly stated in the Abstract. 

We now state in the abstract that the analysis is axisymmetric and
done in the shearing box approximation. Since the models are
vertically-global, we do not use `local' here to avoid confusion. 

***********************************************************************************
2) In section 1.2., in a turbulent system with strong 3D shocks and energy
deposition at different disk height, is the local viscous dissipation still valid? 

This may depend on the origin of turbulence. In the case of
interest here --- gravito-turbulence --- global 3D numerical simulations show
that a local, viscous description is valid for low-mass, thin disks
(Lodato \& Rice, 2004). Shi \& Chiang (2014) have also
confirmed the alpha-beta relation, which reflects local viscous
dissipation, holds in their local 3D simulations with
vertically-extended domains. 

These are stated in Section 1.3, where we specifically discuss
gravito-turbulence.

3) Clarification of the small \gamma (e.g. in equation (11) and big \Gamma
(e.g., in equation (24)) might be needed. Even for the small \gamma,
there is a difference between 2D adiabatic index and 3D adiabatic
index.  

After Eq. 11 we state that \gamma is the adiabatic index that appears
in the ideal gas law for both 2D or 3D disk models. 

After Eq. 24 we

4) In equation (23), is the equilibrium T_{eq} a function of z or just the
midplane value? Later on, when big \Gamma is set to unity, it seems to be a
constant over z. This also leads to the next question, what is the physical
justification of using \Gamma=1 in this study for both 2D and 3D cases?

5) In section 4.1, the first paragraph is puzzling. How could the 'viscosity', a proxy
of the turbulence, do not play an active role in the perturbed state,
especially the turbulence might be driven by gravity itself? 

6) Near the end of section 4.1.1, Rice+(2005,2011) are three-dimensional
simulations not 2D as discussed in this section.

7) Is relation (58) with a fixed Q_{crit} usually used for time evolving,
out-of-equilibrium systems? Is this consistent with the local analysis which 
has fixed equilibrium state? 

8) Near the end of section 4.2, the Authors discuss the fragmentation as a
result of growth rate s=O(\Omega) due to strong viscous stress. But is a
strong growth rate found in Fig 3 equivalent to fragmentation in the turbulent
disk? 

9) How does the vertical velocity \delta v_z obtained in section 5.2 compare
with recent 3D local simulations by Shi & Chiang (2014)? 

10) In Figure 9, is there any reason to label the line of t_c\Omega=4 instead
of t_c\Omega=3?

11) In section 7.1 when discussing the recent issue of numerical convergence,
the Authors attribute the issue to resolution. However, Paardekooper, Baruteau, 
& Meru (2011) and Rice, Forgan & Armitage (2012) argued the convergence problem 
is caused by either initial conditions or the cooling algorithm using SPH. 
Please comment on these aspects in the paper.
