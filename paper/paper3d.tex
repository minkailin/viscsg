Understanding the gravitational stability (GI) of rotating disks   
is fundamental to many astrophysical problems. In the context of 
protoplanetary disks (PPDs), GI has two applications. First, it can
provide gravitational torques to transport angular momentum outwards
and thus enable mass accretion inwards. Secondly, it may lead to disk
fragmentation, which has been invoked to explain planet formation at
large radii. Any realistic study of these phenomena require direct
numerical simulations. Nevertheless, significant progress can be
made through analytical understanding of GI.  %physical insight 

It is now customary to begin any discussion of disk GI with 
the \emph{Toomre criterion}, 
\begin{align}\label{toomreQ_criterion}
  Q \equiv \frac{c_s\kappa}{\pi G \Sigma}<1 
\end{align}
for instability \citep{toomre64}. Here, $c_s$ is the sound-speed,
$\kappa$ is the epicyclic 
frequency (which equals the rotation frequency $\Omega$ in a Keplerian
disk), $\Sigma$ is the surface density and $G$ is the
gravitational constant. This condition describes how self-gravity
($\Sigma$) destabilizes the disk against 
rotation ($\kappa$) and pressure ($c_s$). Eq. \ref{toomreQ_criterion}
formally applies to local, axisymmetric disturbances in a
two-dimensional (2D, razor-thin), inviscid and adiabatic (including
isothermal) disk. 

%assess GI in general 

Despite being a result from ideal disk models, the Toomre $Q$  
parameter is widely applied to assess GI in more general 
situtations. This includes non-ideal, realistic disk structures
obtained with additional physics not encapsulated by $Q$
\citep[e.g.][]{kimura12}.  It is, however, not obvious that such additions
leave the stability condition unaltered. Indeed, we show that GI in more
realistic disk models cannot be described by a single `Toomre-like' 
condition.   

%disk structure may be computed with sophisticated physics but
%stability condition still based on ideal disk models. 
%three main ingredients - gravity, pressure, rotation 
%a standard way to apply this condition is to compute the disk
%structure  based on realistic physics 

The goal of this work is to generalize the analytic treatment of disk 
GI to allow a self-consistent discussion of GI in 
realistic PPD models. Specifically, we will examine the effect of
cooling and viscosity on GI. Their relevance to PPDs are described
below.

%(e.g. gravito-turbulent disks) 

\subsection{Cooling removes pressure support}
A net thermal loss\footnote{Isothermal disks implicitly assume 
  heating and cooling processes are exactly balanced at all
  times, so these do not have cooling in the current context.} (hereafter `cooling')
reduces pressure (thermal) support against self-gravity. The cooling time 
$\tcool$ is the time-scale over which the disk temperature is relaxed
to some pre-defined value, which may be zero. It is 
often written as 
\begin{align} 
  \tcool = \beta \Omega^{-1},
\end{align}
where $\beta$ is the corresponding dimensionless cooling time. 

{\bf physical origin of cooling in PPDs}


The Toomre $Q$ parameter does not include cooling, and thus cannot be 
used to assess GI in realistic disks. Indeed, there exists a separate, 
\emph{empirical} cooling time criterion which governs stability against disk
fragmentation (see below), but its precise value is uncertain.  

We shall quantify, using linear stability analyses, how cooling 
destablize disks. We will find that cooling in fact changes the 
qualitative nature of GI, in that its mere presence can
formally lead to instability.  

\subsection{Viscosity removes rotational support}
It is well known that viscous, self-gravitating disks can develop 
GI even when $Q>1$. This is because viscosity compromises rotational
support against self-gravity for long-wavelength disturbances
\citep{lynden-bell74,willerding92,gammie96}. %also in dusty fluids -
                                %youdin 11 and the inutsuka paper 

Now, accretion disks are often modeled with a Navier-Stokes viscosity
to mimic hydrodynamic or magneto-hydrodynamic turbulence
\citep{shakura73}. This involves writing the
kinematic viscosity $\nu$ as  
\begin{align}\label{alpha_param}
  \nu  = \alpha \frac{c_s^2}{\Omega}, %dimensional argument 
\end{align}
where $\alpha$ is the dimensionless viscosity
coefficient. This
parameterization can be modified to include more complex dependencies on the
fluid variables, but Eq. \ref{alpha_param} is the general form. 

How well turbulence can be modeled as an effective, Navier-Stokes
viscosity is a separate issue \citep{balbus99}. However, it is 
reasonable to assume that turbulence frustates rotational 
support. (This is, after all, a physical cause for mass accretion.) 

Again, viscosity is absent in the Toomre $Q$ parameter. The above
studies account for viscosity but consider isothermal disks. On the
other hand, proper inclusion of viscosity should also account for
viscous heating which, as discussed above, also affect stability. 
We thus extend the study of viscous GI to 
include an energy equation with viscous heating and explicit
cooling. This allows us to consider GI in realistic PPDs.

%but adding viscosity means viscous heating should also be included 

\subsection{Relation to gravito-turbulent disk fragmentation}%and ring
                                %formation 
%can the continous formation/destruction of clumps (as seen in sims)
%be interpreted as `overstability'? 
%for overstable modes over-density oscilates 
The two effects described above are immediately relevant to
`gravito-turbulence'. This is a steady disk state in which cooling is
balanced by turbulent heating, itself caused by GI. In this case 
the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters are inversely related.   

Experimentally, however, it is found that if the imposed $\beta$ is
too small, 
\begin{align}
  \beta < \beta_\mathrm{c},
\end{align}
then the disk fragments. There is considerable debate on the exact
value of $\beta_\mathrm{c}$ and whether or not a critical cooling time can
be defined at all. However, it is generally accepted that \emph{
  steady, gravito-turbulent disks do not exist for sufficiently rapid
cooling}. 

We do not attempt to model disk fragmentation from first
principles. Instead, we simply ask: \emph{when does a 
  gravito-turbulent disk become dynamically unstable?} 
%The two destabilizing agents are cooling and viscosity  
We will find the answer to be consistent with the current consensus on
disk fragmentation. 


%viscous gi speculated by gammie 01 but now found in those sims. but
%longer sims of the same system by paardekooper eventually fragment 









%important to note that this is an experimental results. we refrain
%from using input from numerical simulations in our modeling 
%because we want to explain simulations 
%we will find the regimes where viscous, cooling PPDs are dynamically
%unstbale coincides with where fragmentation occurs 
% we find instability formally possible for long cooling but takes a
% long time
