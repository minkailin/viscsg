\section{Application to protoplanetary disks}\label{2dppd}
We consider the stability of realistic, self-gravitating
protoplanetary disks. Specifically, we will apply our linear framework
to the gravito-turbulent disk model recently developed by 
\cite{rafikov15}. This 2D, Keplerian disk orbits a Solar mass star and 
is defined by the following parameters, 

\begin{itemize}
  \item $\dot{M}$, the global radial accretion rate;
  \item $Q_0$, the value of the 2D Toomre parameter where the disk is
    gravito-turbulent;
  \item $T_\mathrm{irr}$, the irradiation or floor temperature;
  \item $\alpha_m$, the dimensionless viscosity associated with other
    sources of turbulence.
\end{itemize} 
These are used in the statements of thermal equilibrium, mass and
angular momentum conservation, together with an opacity law, 
to construct a global disk model with surface density $\Sigma(R)$ and
temperature $T(R)$ where $R$ is the global cylindrical radius from the
star. This gives the $Q(R)$ value required for input
into our linear framework. We derive other dimensionless
parameters below. 

Note that we are considering the local stability at each radius. We
are thus neglecting the slow, background viscous radial flow in the
linear problem. 

%proper treatment of cooling  in 3d
%vertically isothermal basic state for simplicity (also appropriate for
%irradiated disks) --- this formally requires zero viscosity  
%or have viscosity but assume it does not affect basic state (dominated
%by irradiation) but affect perturbations 

\subsection{Effective $\alpha$}
In a steady, viscously accreting Keplerian disk we have,
approximately, $\nu\Sigma = \dot{M}/3\pi$. Hence
\begin{align}
  \alpha = \frac{\dot{M}}{3\pi}\frac{\Omega(R)}{c_{s}^2(T)\Sigma(R)},  
\end{align} 
which sets the viscosity coefficient to be used at each radius. 

\subsection{PPD cooling}
Energy loss in \citeauthor{rafikov15}'s model is given
by 
\begin{align}\label{real_cool}
  \Lambda = \frac{2\sigma}{f(\tau)}\left(T^4 - T_\mathrm{irr}^4\right)
\end{align}
per unit area, 
\begin{align}
  f(\tau) = \tau + \frac{1}{\tau},
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
  \tau = \kappa_d(T)\Sigma
\end{align}
is the optical depth and recall Eq. \ref{opacity_law} 
is our opacity model. 
%and $\kappa_d$ is the opacity. 
%We parameterize
%\begin{align}
%  \kappa_d = \kappa_{d0} \Sigma^a T^b,
%\end{align}
%where $\kappa_{d0}, a, b$ are constants. 

Since we are interested in the linear response of the system, the
corresponding parameters $\beta$ and $\theta$ are found by
comparing the linearized form of the cooling function
(Eq. \ref{real_cool}) to that of the model function
(Eq. \ref{beta_cool}).  

%{\bf as opposed to comparing their unperturbed forms, as done in literature}

Linearizing Eq. \ref{real_cool} gives   
\begin{align}\label{linear_real_cool}
  (\gamma-1)\frac{\delta\Lambda}{\Sigma} = \frac{2\sigma(\gamma-1)
    T^4C_1}{f(\tau)c_{s}^2\Sigma}\left(\frac{\delta P}{\Sigma} -
  \frac{C_2}{C_1}c_{s}^2\frac{\delta\Sigma}{\Sigma}\right), 
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
C_1(\tau, T) &= 4 - b\times g(\tau, T),\\ 
C_2(\tau, T) &= 4 + (1-b)\times g(\tau, T),\\ 
  g(\tau, T) &= \left( \frac{\tau^2-1}{\tau^2+1}\right)\left(1 -
  \frac{T_\mathrm{irr}^4}{T^4}\right). 
\end{align}
Comparing Eq. \ref{linear_real_cool} with Eq. \ref{beta_cool}, we identify
\begin{align}
  &\beta = \frac{f(\tau)c_s^2\Sigma\Omega}{2\sigma(\gamma-1)C_1T^4},\\
  &\theta = \frac{C_2}{C_1}, 
\end{align}
to be used in the 2D linear framework. 

This `realistic' beta cooling prescription can behave differently to 
our previous, simple beta cooling (Eq. \ref{beta_cool}) for the same
physical system. In particular, for a non-irradiated disk
($T_\mathrm{irr}=0$), simple beta 
cooling has  $\theta=0$, but realistic beta cooling has $\theta\neq
0$. However, fully-irradiated disks with $T=T_\mathrm{irr}$ can be
modeled by simple beta cooling since in both cases $\theta=1$.  


%{\bf caution in applying numerical results obtained from beta cooling to
%systems modeled with real cooling. above example shows that to model
%real, non-irradiated disk with beta cooling actually requires irradiation in
%the latter.}

%Notice that $\theta\to 1$ as 
%$T\toT_\mathrm{irr}$ the disk becomes passive. 

\subsection{Inviscid stability condition} 
%We specialize to $a=0, b=2$ for the opacity law. 
We note that for the adopted opacity law, Eq. \ref{opacity_law}, 
\begin{align*}
  \theta = \frac{4-g}{4-2g},
\end{align*}
implying $5/6<\theta<3/2$. 
%For a non-irradiated disk, $T_\mathrm{irr}=0$, $\theta\to5/6$ as
%$\tau\to0$ and $\theta\to3/2$ as $\tau\to\infty$.  
From our discussion in \S\ref{2d_inviscid}, we conclude that this
system cannot be unstable without
viscous effects acting on the perturbations if 
\begin{align}
  \gamma > \frac{3}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad Q > \sqrt{\frac{6}{5}} \label{ppd_invisc_cond}
\end{align} 
are both satisfied.  

\subsection{Example 2D calculation}\label{pp2d_example}
We consider a disk with $\dot{M} = 10^{-6}M_\sun\,\yr^{-1}$, $Q_0=1.5$, 
$\tirr=10\mathrm{K}$, and $\alpha_m=10^{-3}$. For the adopted opacity
law we follow \citeauthor{rafikov15} and take $\kappa_{d0} =
5\times10^{-4}\mathrm{cm}^2\,\mathrm{g}^{-1}\,\mathrm{K}^{-2}$. Here we use
$\gamma=1.6$ so the inviscid stability condition
(Eq. \ref{ppd_invisc_cond}) is satisfied. 
%{\bf actually this opacity law only valid $>30$au for this disk}

Fig. \ref{rafikov_model} shows the equilirbium disk profile in terms
of $Q$, $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\theta$. These are set as input to the
2D dispersion relation to yield a growth timescale, in units of the
local orbital period, shown in Fig. \ref{rafikov_growth}. We also plot
an analytic estimate based on Eq. \ref{gammie_smallk} (instead of
Eq. \ref{gammie_maxrate_simple} since here $\theta\sim 1$) which gives 
\begin{align}
  S = \frac{27\alpha}{16\theta^3Q^4}, 
\end{align}
and the optimum wavenumber is
\begin{align}
  |K| = \frac{3}{2\theta Q}.
\end{align}
%For the
%stability calculation we use $\mu=-1, \lambda=0$ for the viscosity
%prescription.  

The disk becomes dynamically unstable with growth timescales $\lesssim
10$ orbits for $R\gtrsim60$AU. Coincidentally, beyond this radius
$\alpha\gtrsim 0.1$ and $\beta\lesssim 3$, which is often quoted as 
criteria for disk fragmentation \citep[e.g.][]{rafikov15}. 
%{\bf despite apply beta cooling results to realistic cooling disks}
Our result suggest an alternative interpretation of disk fragmentation
is where the gravito-turbulent state becomes dynamically unstable due to
both viscosity and self-gravity. 

Fig. \ref{rafikov_model} shows that the most unstable wavelength is a
few times the disk thickness. The increase in $|K|$ from $\sim
10\mathrm{AU}$ to $\sim 20\mathrm{AU}$ is due to the decrease in $Q$;
while that from $\sim 60\mathrm{AU}$ to $\sim 100\mathrm{AU}$ occurs
as the disk transitions from optically thick to optically thin
regimes. The mismatch at large distances is not surprising since the
above expressions assume $|K|\ll 1$. Nevertheless the analytic
estimates reproduce the correct behavior. 

%{\bf note: disk might be stablized by extremely large alpha at large
%  distances but `turbulent' framework no longer valid }

\subsection{3D PPD}
%{\bf radiative diffusion only for optically thick disk. how to connect
%to optically thin regions?}
We briefly consider 3D PPDs subject to explicit radiative diffusion 
(\S\ref{rad_cool}). Given the $\alpha(R)$ and $Q(R)$ profiles obtained
from the 2D model above, at each radius $R$ we obtain the vertical
structure from Eq. \ref{vert_eq1}---\ref{thermal_eq}, with 
Eq. \ref{rad_cool1}---\ref{rad_cool2} for the radiative flux.
We then solve the 3D eigenvalue problem as in \S\ref{3ddisk}, with the
additional boundary condition $\delta T^\prime(0) = \delta T(\zmax) = 0$.    
We use the same disk model as in \S\ref{pp2d_example} but without 
irradiation ($T_\mathrm{irr}=0$), and a slightly smaller vertical
domain with $\rho(\zmax)=0.1\rho_0$.  %to avoid very low density 

Fig. \ref{rafikov_growth3d} show the growth rates and most unstable
wavenumber for $R\in[10,100]$AU. We also plot the corresponding 2D
results with softened self-gravity. There is a close match for
$R\lesssim60$AU where the disk is optically thick ($\tau\gtrsim
1$) and both models apply. However, beyond $60$AU where the disk is
optically thin, radiative diffusion (the 3D curve) does not apply and
under-estimates the growth rates. Nevertheless, the comparison shows
that the transition radius $R\sim60$AU can be calculated within the 2D
framework. This is not surprising since the instability is 
fundamentally driven by viscous and self-gravity forces in the
momentum equations, not the energy equation. 

%the instability is due to viscosity/gravity in momenta equation so
%details of energy eq doesn't matter

%3d rad diffusion is mathematically different problem (more
%derivatives) so worth considering briefly
%optically thin cooling in 3D is the same problem as before

%use 2D model as midplane values to get 3D structure assuming radiative
%diffusion and constant alpha w.r.t. height. allow cooling time to vary
%with height. can't assume polytropic vertical structure. need to
%reformulate linear framework (some transformations needed). 
%skip 2D eigen prob if 3D works out
